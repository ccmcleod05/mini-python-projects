# FOOD HEALTH RANKER

### About
This is a food ranking algorithm that uses a formula to scale the different nutritional components of foods and rank them. The scale is one through five, where one is very bad, two is bad, three is okay, four is good, and five is very good. The website used to get food data is (https://www.nutritionvalue.org).

### Setup
To run the algorithm, you need a [chrome web driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and Google Chrome. Make sure the driver version is compatible with your Chrome version. For example, the driver prefix of 104 indicates that the Chrome version must also have a prefix of 104. Then, specify the path of the installed chrome web driver in a .env file based on the .env.example file.
